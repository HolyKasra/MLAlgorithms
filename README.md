# ML algorithms Implementation

> Implementing traditional machine learning algorithms from scratch!

## Algorithms Implemented

- KNN (Classification and Regression)
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- SVM (hard margin + kernel flexibility)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest (Classification and Regression)
- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boost (Classification and Regression)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Discriminant Analysis Algorithms (LDA + QDA)
- K-Means Clustering (using K-Means++ center initialization)
- [More Algorithms will be added soon...]

## Installation and usage.

This project has below dependencies

- `numpy` for the maths implementation and writing the algorithms
- `Scikit-learn` for the data generation and testing.
- `Matplotlib` for the plotting
- `collections` for some implementations
